## Description
Tutor's premise would be to connect people together to find tutors who will provide services for those needing tutoring on specific subjects. The user would ping their location and what they need tutoring in, and tutors who are looking for work can pick up the job. Users will have to use phone number authentication to hold account holders liable. Tutors can customize their account to their liking, and better their account by increasing an implemented "star rating" system. Tutors who sign up will go through screening by monitoring the teachers overall quality of teaching.
