* As an avid book reader, I visit the library to find a nice and quiet place to read. There's nothing worse than being immersed into a story about vikings, just to have a phone go off and destroy my immersion. Having an app that could silence my phone for me would help library attendee's such as myself the service of silencing our phones without having to remember to do so.

* Being a movie fanatic, I ritually watch movies at my local theater to watch the latest and greatest movies. In all of me experiences, having a phone go off during a movie is extrememly distracting. If there was a way to automatically silence the phones of those who forget to do so, it would provide people with the convenience of silencing their phones for them without having to do it themselves.
